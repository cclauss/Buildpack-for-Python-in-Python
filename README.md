Buildpack for Python written in Python
======================================

Python Buildpack supporting BlueMix and CloudFoundry written in Python

The current Heroku Buildpacks for Python are written in bash and have not been updated to support current Python release.

The goals of this effort are to create a Python Buildpack that:

* Is written in Python
* Supports BlueMix
* Supports current Python environments:
    * Python 2.7.8
        * Python 3.4.1
        * Pypy2  2.3.1
        * Pypy3  2.3.1
        * Django 2.6.5

This will make Python more of a first class language in BlueMix.
